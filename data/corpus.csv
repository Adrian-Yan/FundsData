", the sub -fund s net derivative exposure may be up to 50% of its net asset value. ,"? investment involves risks. please refer to the offering document for details including the risk factors. - 5 - investment risk the sub -fund s investment portfolio may fall in value due to any of the key risk factors below and therefore your investment in the sub -fund may suffer losses. there is no guarantee of the repayment of principal. asset allocation strategy risk the performance of the sub -fund with an asset allocation strategy is partially dependent on the success of the asset allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund at any particular time. accordingly, in such circumstances, there is no assurance that the ass et allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund will be successful and therefore the investment objectives of the sub-fund may not be achieved. also, the investments of the sub -fund may be periodically rebalanced and therefore the sub -fund may incur greate r transaction costs than a fund with static allocation strategy. risks of investing in other collective investment schemes/funds the sub -fund will be subject to the risks associated with the underlying funds , particularly where the sub -fund predominantly invests in underlying funds . the sub -fund does not have control of the investments of the underlying funds and there is no assurance that the investment objective and strategy of the underlying funds will be successfully achieved which may ha ve a negative impact on the net asset value of the sub -fund. the underlying funds in which the sub -fund may invest may not be regulated by the sfc. there may be additional costs involved when investing into these underlying funds. there is also no guarant ee that the underlying funds will always have sufficient liquidity to meet the sub -fund s redemption requests as and when made. risks associated with investing in funds with a sustainable investment focus investing in sub -funds with a sustainable investment focus ( si focused funds ) that are primarily exposed to issuers demonstrating sustainability characteristics carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the si focused fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a su stainable investment strategy. the implementation of the sustainable investment strategy of a si focused fund may result in foregoing opportunities to buy certain securities when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, and/or selling securities when it might be disadvantageous to do so. this may adversely affect the si focused fund s investment performance. as an si focused fund focuses on esg investments, the value of the sub -fund may be more volatile than that of a fund having a more diverse portfol io of investments. in assessing the eligibility of an issuer, there is a dependence upon information and data from external research data providers and internal analyses, which may be subjective, incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable. as a result, there is a risk of incorrectly or subjectively assessing a security or issuer or there is a risk that the sub -fund could have exposure to issuers who do not meet the relevant criteria. in addition, there is a lack of standardized taxonomy of esg investments. neither the fund, the management company nor a portfolio manager make any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, accuracy, reasonableness or completeness of an assessment of external research data, the applic ation of the standards issued by united nations sustainable development goals and other sustainability/esg criteria, and the correct execution of sustainability strategy. risks associated with equities the sub -fund's direct and/or indirect exposure in equity securities is subject to general market risks, whose value may fluctuate due to various factors, such as changes in investment sentiment, political and economic conditions and issuer -specific factors. risk of investing in small capitalisation / mid capitalisation companies : the stocks of small - capitalisation/mid -capitalisation companies may have lower liquidity and their prices are more volatile to adverse economic developments than those of larger capitalisation companies in general. as such, th is may adversely impact the sub -fund and/or the interests of investors. risks associated with debt securities credit / counterparty risk : the sub -fund is directly and/or indirectly exposed to the credit/ default risk of issuers of the debt securities that the sub -fund may invest in. interest rate risk : investment in the sub -fund is subject to interest rate risk. in general, the prices of debt securities rise when interest rates fall, whilst their prices fall where interest rates rise. volati lity and liquidity risk : the debt securities in certain markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to more developed markets. the prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuations. the bid and offer sp reads of the price of - 6 - such securities may be large and the sub -fund may incur significant trading costs. downgrading risk : the credit rating of a debt instrument or its issuer may subsequently be downgraded. in the event of such downgrading, the value of t he sub -fund may be adversely affected. the portfolio manager may or may not be able to dispose of the debt instruments that are being downgraded. valuation risk : valuation of the sub -fund s investments may involve uncertainties and judgemental determinatio ns. if such variation turns out to be incorrect, this may affect the net asset value calculation of the sub -fund. credit rating risk : credit ratings assigned by rating agencies are subject to limitations and do not guarantee to creditworthiness of the secu rity and/or the issuer at all times. below investment grade or unrated risk : the sub -fund may be directly and/or indirectly exposed to debt securities rated below investment grade or unrated. such securities are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and interest than high -rated debt securities. currency risk underlying investments of the sub -fund may be denominated in currencies other than the base currency of the sub -fund. also, a class of units may be designated in a currency other than the base currency of the sub -fund. the net asset value of the sub -fund and/or class of unit may be affected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rates between these currencies and the base currency and by changes in exchange rate controls. rmb currency risk rmb is not a freely convertible currency and it is subject to foreign exchange control policies of and repatriation restrictions imposed by the prc government. under exceptional circumstances, payment of redemptions and/or dividend in rmb in respect of rmb denominated classes may be delayed due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to rmb . non-rmb based investors are exposed to foreign exchange risk and there is no guarantee that the value of rmb against the investors base currencies (eg. hkd) or the sub -fund s base currency will not depreciate. any depreciation of rmb could adversely affect the value of the investor s investment in the sub -fund. rmb denominated classes are denominated in cnh. the rates of offshore rmb (cnh) and onshore r mb (cny) are different and any divergence between cnh and cny may adversely impact the value of investments in the sub -fund. emerging market risks the sub -fund is exposed to emerging markets which may involve increased risks and special considerations not typically associated with investment in more developed markets, such as liquidity risks, currency risks/ control, political and economic uncertainties, legal and taxation risks, settlement risks, custody risk and the likelihood of a high degree of volatil ity. risks associated with investments in instruments with loss -absorption features debt instruments with loss -absorption features are subject to greater risks when compared to traditional debt instruments as such instruments are typically subject to the risk of being written down or converted to ordinary shares upon the occurrence of a pre -defined trigger events (e.g. when the issuer is near or at the point of non -viability or when the issuer s capital ratio falls to a specified level), which are like ly to be outside of the issuer s control. such trigger events are complex and difficult to predict and may result in a significant or total reduction in the value of such instruments. in the event of the activation of a trigger, there may be potential pric e contagion and volatility to the entire asset class. debt instruments with loss -absorption features may also be exposed to liquidity, valuation and sector concentration risk. the sub -fund may be exposed to contingent convertible debt securities, commonly known as cocos, which are highly complex and are of high risk. upon the occurrence of the trigger event, cocos may be converted into shares of the issuer (potentially at a discounted price), or may be subject to the permanent write -down to zero. coupon pa yments on cocos are discretionary and may be cancelled by the issuer at any point, for any reason, and for any length of time. the sub -fund may be exposed to senior non -preferred debts. while these instruments are generally senior to subordinated debts, t hey may be subject to write -down upon the occurrence of a trigger event and will no longer fall under the creditor ranking hierarchy of the issuer. this may result in total loss of principal invested. - 7 - risks relating to securities lending transactions securities lending transactions may involve the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities lent out in a timely manner and the value of the collateral may fall below the value of the securities lent out. risks of implementing ac tive currency position as the active currency position implemented by the sub -fund may not be correlated with the underlying securities positions held by the sub -fund, the sub -fund may suffer a significant or total loss even if there is no loss of the valu e of the underlying securities positions being fixed income securities held by the sub -fund. risks associated with distribution out of/effectively out of the sub -fund s capital payment of dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment. any such distributions may result in an immediate reduction of the net as set value per unit. the distribution amount and net asset value of the hedged class of units may be adversely affected by differences in the interest rates of the reference currency of the hedged class and the sub -fund s base currency, resulting in an increase in the amount of distribution that is paid out of capital and hence a greater erosion of capital than other non -hedged classes. risks relating to unit classes with a fixed percentage in their names constant distributing unit classes must not be s een as alternative to savings account or fixed - interest paying investment. the constant distribution unit class does not distribute a fixed amount. rather a fixed percentage will apply to the nav of the sub -fund as of the end of the month. the constant per centage distribution results in higher absolute distributions when navs are high and in lower absolute distributions when navs are low. hence, the absolute distributions received by investors may vary from month to month. the percentage distribution rate o f any unit class is unrelated to expected or past income or return of the unit class or the sub -fund. the distribution can thus be higher or lower than the income and return that were effectively realized. these unit classes continue to distribute in perio ds that the sub -fund has negative return / is making losses, which further reduces the net asset value of the sub -fund. in extreme circumstances, investors may not be able to get back the original investment amount. risk relating to hedged classes the hedging strategy for a class of units which is hedged against the base currency of the sub - fund, may not work as intended, exposing investors of that class to currency risk. additionally, investors of a hedged class may be exposed to fluctuations in the ne t asset value per unit reflecting the gains/losses on and the associated transaction costs of the financial instruments used for hedging, and such investors may be adversely impacted. "," - 8 - past performance information is not indicative of future performance. investors may not get back the full amount invested. the computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, nav -to-nav, with dividend reinvested. these figures show by how much the unit class increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. performance data has been calculated in usd including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have to pay. sub-fund launch date: 1994 p-acc launch date: 1994 p-acc is selected as representative unit class as it is the major unit class subscribed by investors or denominated in the sub -fund s base currency.

", the sub -fund s net derivative exposure may be up to 50% of its net asset value. ,"? investment involves risks. please refer to the offering document for details including the risk factors. investment risk the sub -fund s investment portfolio may fall in value due to any of the key risk factors below and therefore your investment in the sub-fund may suffer losses. there is no guarantee of the repayment of principal. risks of investing in other collective investment schemes/funds the sub -fund will be subject to the risks associated with the underlying funds , particularly where the sub-fund predominantly invests in underlying funds . the sub -fund does not have control of the investments of the underlying funds and there is no assurance that the investment objective and strategy of the underlying funds will be successfully achieved which may have a negative impact on the net asset val ue of the sub -fund. the underlying funds in which the sub -fund may invest may not be regulated by the sfc. there may be additional costs involved when investing into these underlying funds. there is also no - 5 - guarantee that the underlying funds will always have sufficient liquidity to meet the sub -fund s redemption requests as and when made. risks associated with investing in funds with a sustainable investment focus investing in sub -funds with a sustainable investment focus ( si focused funds ) that are primarily exposed to issuers demonstrating sustainability characteristics carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the si focused fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a sustainable investment strategy. the implementation of the sustainable investment strategy of a si focused fund may result in foregoing opportunities to buy certain securities when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, and/or selling securities when it might be disadvantageous to do so. this may adverse ly affect the si focused fund s investment performance. as an si focused fund focuses on esg investments, the value of the sub -fund may be more volatile than that of a fund having a more diverse portfolio of investments. in assessing the eligibility of an issuer, there is a dependence upon information and data from external research data providers and internal analyses, which may be subjective, incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable. as a result, there is a risk of incorrectly or subjectively assessing a security or issuer or there is a risk that the sub -fund could have exposure to issuers who do not meet the relevant criteria. in addition, there is a lack of standardized taxonomy of esg investments. neither the fund, the management company nor a portfolio m anager make any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, accuracy, reasonableness or completeness of an assessment of external research data, the application of sustainability/esg criteria and the correct e xecution of sustainability strategy. risks associated with debt securities credit / counterparty risk : the sub -fund is directly and/or indirectly exposed to the credit/ default risk of issuers of the debt securities that the sub -fund may invest in. interest rate risk : investment in the sub -fund is subject to interest rate risk. in general, the prices of debt securities rise when interest rates fall, whilst their prices fall where interest rates rise. volatility and liquidity risk : the debt securities in certain markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to more developed markets. the prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuations. the bid and offer spreads of the price of such securities may be large and the sub -fund may incur significant trading costs. downgrading risk : the credit rating of a debt instrument or its issuer may subsequently be downgraded. in the event of such downgrading, the value of the sub -fund may be adversely affected. the p ortfolio manager may or may not be able to dispose of the debt instruments that are being downgraded. valuation risk : valuation of the sub -fund s investments may involve uncertainties and judgemental determinations. if such variation turns out to be incorr ect, this may affect the net asset value calculation of the sub -fund. credit rating risk : credit ratings assigned by rating agencies are subject to limitations and do not guarantee to creditworthiness of the security and/or the issuer at all times. below investment grade or unrated risk : the sub -fund may be directly and/or indirectly exposed to debt securities rated below investment grade or unrated. such securities are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and interest than high -rated debt securities. currency risk underlying investments of the sub -fund may be denominated in currencies other than the base currency of the sub -fund. also, a class of units may be designated in a currency other than the base currency of the sub -fund. the net asset value of the sub -fund and/or class of unit may be affected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rates between these currencies and the base currency and by changes in exchange rate controls. rmb currency risk rmb is not a freely convertible currency and it is subject to foreign exchange control policies of and repatriation restrictions imposed by the prc government. under exceptional - 6 - circumstances, payment of redemptions and/or dividend in rmb in respect of rm b denominated classes may be delayed due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to rmb . non-rmb based investors are exposed to foreign exchange risk and there is no guarantee that the value of rmb against the investors base currencies (eg. h kd) or the sub -fund s base currency will not depreciate. any depreciation of rmb could adversely affect the value of the investor s investment in the sub -fund. rmb denominated classes are denominated in cnh. the rates of offshore rmb (cnh) and onshore rmb (cny) are different and any divergence between cnh and cny may adversely impact the value of investments in the sub -fund. emerging market risks the sub -fund is exposed to emerging markets which may involve increased risks and special considerations not typically associated with investment in more developed markets, such as liquidity risks, currency risks/ control, political and economic uncertainties, legal and taxation risks, settlement risks, custody risk and the likelihood of a high degree of volatility. risks associated with investments in instruments with loss -absorption features debt instruments with loss -absorption features are subject to greater risks when compared to traditional debt instruments as such instruments are typically subject to the risk of being written down or converted to ordinary shares upon the occurrence of a pre -defined trigger events (e.g. when the issuer is near or at the point of non -viability or when the issuer s capital ratio falls to a specified level), which are likely to be outside of the issuer s control. such trigger events are complex and difficult to predict and may result in a significant or total reduction in the value of such instruments. in the event of the activation of a trigger, there may be potential price contagion and volatility to the entire asset class. debt instruments with loss -absorption features may also be exposed to liquidity, valuation and sector concentration risk. the sub -fund may be exposed to contingent convertible debt securities, commonly known as cocos, which are highly complex and are of high risk. upon the occurrence of the trigger event, cocos may be converted into shares of the issuer (potentially at a discounted price), or may be subject to the permanent write -down to zero. coupon payments on cocos are discretionary and may be cancelled by the issuer at any point, for any reason, and for any length of time. the sub -fund may be exposed to senior non -preferred debts. while these instruments are generally senior to subordinated debts, they may be subject to write -down upon the occurrence of a trigger event and will no longer fall under the creditor ranking hierarchy of the issuer. this may result in tot al loss of principal invested. risks relating to securities lending transactions securities lending transactions may involve the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities lent out in a timely manner and the value of the collateral may fall below the value of the securities lent out. risks of implementing active currency position as the active currency position implemented by the sub -fund may not be correlated with the underlying securities positions held by the sub-fund, the sub -fund may suffer a significant or total loss even if there is no loss of the value of the underlying securities positions being fixed income securities held by the sub -fund. risks associated with distribution out of/effectively out of the sub-fund s capital payment of dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment. any such distributions may result in an immediate redu ction of the net asset value per unit. the distribution amount and net asset value of the hedged class of units may be adversely affected by differences in the interest rates of the reference currency of the hedged class and the sub -fund s base currency, r esulting in an increase in the amount of distribution that is paid out of capital and hence a greater erosion of capital than other non -hedged classes. - 7 - risks relating to unit classes with a fixed percentage in their names constant distributing unit classes must not be seen as alternative to savings account or fixed - interest paying investment. the constant distribution unit class does not distribute a fixed amount. rather a fixed percentage will apply to the nav of the sub -fund as of the end of the month. the constant percentage distribution results in higher absolute distributions when navs are high and in lower absolute distributions when navs are low. hence, the absolute distributions received by investors may vary from month to mo nth. the percentage distribution rate of any unit class is unrelated to expected or past income or return of the unit class or the sub -fund. the distribution can thus be higher or lower than the income and return that were effectively realized. these unit classes continue to distribute in periods that the sub -fund has negative return / is making losses, which further reduces the net asset value of the sub -fund. in extreme circumstances, investors may not be able to get back the original investment amount. risk relating to hedged classes the hedging strategy for a class of units which is hedged against the base currency of the sub - fund, may not work as intended, exposing investors of that class to currency risk. additionally, investors of a hedged class may be exposed to fluctuations in the net asset value per unit reflecting the gains/losses on and the associated transaction costs of the financial instruments used for hedging, and such investors may be adversely impacted. "," past performance information is not indicative of future performance. inv estors may not get back the full amount invested. the computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, nav -to-nav, with dividend reinvested. these figures show by how much the unit class increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. performance data has been calculated in usd including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have to pay. sub-fund launch date: 1992 p-acc la unch date: 1992 p-acc is selected as representative unit class as it is the major unit class subscribed by investors or denominated in the sub -fund s base currency.

", the sub -fund s net derivative exposure may be up to 50% of its net asset value. ,"? investment involves risks. please refer to the offering document for details including the risk factors. investment risk the sub -fund s investment portfolio may fall in value due to any of the key risk factors below and therefore your investment in the sub -fund may suffer losses. there is no guarantee of the repayment of principal. risks of investing in other collective investment schemes/funds the sub -fund will be subject to the risks associated with the underlying funds , particularly where the sub -fund predominantly invests in underlying funds . the sub -fund does not have control of the investments of the underlying funds and there is no assurance that the investment objective and strategy of the underlying funds will be successfully a chieved which may have a negative impact on the net asset value of the sub -fund. - 5 - the underlying funds in which the sub -fund may invest may not be regulated by the sfc. there may be additional costs involved when investing into these underlying funds. ther e is also no guarantee that the underlying funds will always have sufficient liquidity to meet the sub -fund s redemption requests as and when made. asset allocation strategy risk the performance of the sub -fund with an asset allocation strategy is partially dependent on the success of the asset allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund at any particular time. accordingly, in such circumstances, there is no assurance that the ass et allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund will be successful and therefore the investment objectives of the sub-fund may not be achieved. also, the investments of the sub -fund may be periodically rebalanced and therefore the sub -fund may incur greate r transaction costs than a fund with static allocation strategy. risks associated with investing in funds with a sustainable investment focus investing in sub -funds with a sustainable investment focus ( si focused funds ) that are primarily exposed to issuers demonstrating sustainability characteristics carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the si focused fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a sustainable investment strategy. the implementation of the sustainable investmen t strategy of a si focused fund may result in foregoing opportunities to buy certain securities when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, and/or selling securities when it might be disadvantageous to do so. this may adversely affect the si focused fund s investment performance. as an si focused fund focuses on esg investments, the value of the sub -fund may be more volatile than that of a fund having a more diverse portfolio of investments. in assessing the eligibility of an issuer, there is a depend ence upon information and data from external research data providers and internal analyses, which may be subjective, incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable. as a result, there is a risk of incorrectly or subjectively assessing a security or issuer or there is a risk that the sub -fund could have exposure to issuers who do not meet the relevant criteria. in addition, there is a lack of standardized taxonomy of esg investments. neither the fund, the management company nor a portfolio manager make any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, accuracy, reasonableness or completeness of an assessment of external research data, the ap plication of the standards issued by united nations sustainable development goals and other sustainability/esg criteria, and the correct execution of sustainability strategy. risks associated with equities the sub -fund's direct and/or indirect exposure to equity securities is subject to general market risks, whose value may fluctuate due to various factors, such as changes in investment sentiment, political and economic conditions and issuer -specific factors. risk of investing in small capitalisation / mi d capitalisation companies : the stocks of small - capitalisation/mid -capitalisation companies may have lower liquidity and their prices are more volatile to adverse economic developments than those of larger capitalisation companies in general. as such, this may adversely impact the sub -fund and/or the interests of investors. risks associated with debt securities credit / counterparty risk : the sub -fund is directly and/or indirectly exposed to the credit/ default risk of issuers of the debt securities that t he sub -fund may invest in. interest rate risk : investment in the sub -fund is subject to interest rate risk. in general, the prices of debt securities rise when interest rates fall, whilst their prices fall where interest rates rise. volatility and liquidit y risk : the debt securities in certain markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to more developed markets. the prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuations. the bid and offer spreads of the pric e of such securities may be large and the sub -fund may incur significant trading costs. downgrading risk : the credit rating of a debt instrument or its issuer may subsequently be downgraded. in the event of such downgrading, the value of the sub -fund may b e adversely affected. the portfolio manager may or may not be able to dispose of the debt instruments that - 6 - are being downgraded. valuation risk : valuation of the sub -fund s investments may involve uncertainties and judgemental determinations. if such variation turns out to be incorrect, this may affect the net asset value calculation of the sub -fund. credit rating risk : credit ratings assigned by rating agencies are subject to limitations and do not guarantee to creditworthiness of the security and/or the issuer at all times. below investment grade or unrated risk : the sub -fund may be directly and/or indirectly exposed to debt securities rated below investment grade or unrated. such securities are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and interest than high -rated debt securities. currency risk underlying investments of the sub -fund may be denominated in currencies other than the base currency of the sub -fund. also, a class of units may be designated in a currency other than the base currency of the sub -fund. the net asset value of the sub -fund and/or class of unit may be affected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rates between these currencies and the base currency and by changes in exchange rate controls. rmb currency risk rmb is not a freely convertible currency and it is subject to foreign exchange control policies of and repatriation restrictions imposed by the prc government. under exceptional circumstances, payment of redemptions and/or dividend in rmb in respect of rmb denominated classes may be delayed due to the exchange co ntrols and restrictions applicable to rmb . non-rmb based investors are exposed to foreign exchange risk and there is no guarantee that the value of rmb against the investors base currencies (eg. hkd) or the sub -fund s base currency will not depreciate. any depreciation of rmb could adversely affect the value of the investor s investment in the sub -fund. rmb denominated classes are denominated in cnh. the rates of offshore rmb (cnh) and onshore r mb (cny) are different and any divergence between cnh and cny may adversely impact the value of investments in the sub -fund. emerging market risks the sub -fund is exposed to emerging markets which may involve increased risks and special considerations not typically associated with investment in more developed markets, such as liquidity risks, currency risks/ control, political and economic uncertainties, legal and taxation risks, settlement risks, custody risk and the likelihood of a high degree of volatility. risks associated with investments in instruments with loss -absorption features debt instruments with loss -absorption features are subject to greater risks when compared to traditional debt instruments as such instruments are typically subject to the risk of being written down or converted to ordinary shares upon the occurrence of a pre -defined trigger events (e.g. when the issuer is near or at the point of non -viability or when the issuer s capital ratio falls to a specified level), which are likely to be outside of the issuer s control. such trigger events are complex and difficult to predict and may result in a significant or total reduction in the value of such instrum ents. in the event of the activation of a trigger, there may be potential price contagion and volatility to the entire asset class. debt instruments with loss -absorption features may also be exposed to liquidity, valuation and sector concentration risk. the sub -fund may be exposed to contingent convertible debt securities, commonly known as cocos, which are highly complex and are of high risk. upon the occurrence of the trigger event, cocos may be converted into shares of the issuer (potentially at a disco unted price), or may be subject to the permanent write -down to zero. coupon payments on cocos are discretionary and may be cancelled by the issuer at any point, for any reason, and for any length of time. the sub -fund may be exposed to senior non -preferre d debts. while these instruments are generally senior to subordinated debts, they may be subject to write -down upon the occurrence of a trigger event and will no longer fall under the creditor ranking hierarchy of the issuer. this may result in total loss of principal invested. - 7 - risks relating to securities lending transactions securities lending transactions may involve the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities lent out in a timely manner and the value of the collateral may fall below the value of the securities lent out. risks of implementing active currency position as the active currency position implemented by the sub -fund may not be correlated with the underlying securities positions held by the sub -fund, the sub -fund may su ffer a significant or total loss even if there is no loss of the value of the underlying securities positions being fixed income securities held by the sub -fund. risks associated with distribution out of/effectively out of the sub -fund s capital payment o f dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment. any such distributions may result in an immediate reduction of the net asset value per unit. the distribution amount and net asset value of the hedged class of units may be adversely affected by differences in the interest rates of the reference currency of the hedged class and the sub -fund s base currency, resulting in an increase in the amount of distribution that is paid out of capital and hence a greater erosion of capital than other non -hedged classes. risks relating to unit classes with a fixed percentage in their names constant distributing unit classes must not be seen as alternative to savings account or fixed - interest paying investment. the constant distribution unit class does not distribute a fixed amount. rather a fixed percentage will apply to the nav of the sub -fund as of the end of the month. the constant percentage distribution results in higher absolute distributions when navs are high and in lower absolute distributions when navs are low. hence, the absolute distributions received by investors may vary from mo nth to month. the percentage distribution rate of any unit class is unrelated to expected or past income or return of the unit class or the sub -fund. the distribution can thus be higher or lower than the income and return that were effectively realized. th ese unit classes continue to distribute in periods that the sub -fund has negative return / is making losses, which further reduces the net asset value of the sub -fund. in extreme circumstances, investors may not be able to get back the original investment amount. risk relating to hedged classes the hedging strategy for a class of units which is hedged against the base currency of the sub - fund, may not work as intended, exposing investors of that class to currency risk. additionally, investors of a hedged class may be exposed to fluctuations in the net asset value per unit reflecting the gains/losses on and the associated transaction costs of the financial instruments used for hedging, and such investors may be adversely impacted. "," - 8 - past performance information is not indicative of future performance. investors may not get back the full amount invested. the computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, nav -to-nav, with dividend reinvested. these figures show by how much the unit class increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. performance data has been calculated in usd including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have to pay. sub-fund launch date: 1991 p-acc launch date: 1991 p-acc is selected as representative unit class as it is the major unit class subscribed by investors or denominated in the sub -fund s base currency.

5 - the underlying funds in whi ch the sub -fund may invest may not be regulated by the sfc. there may be additional costs involved when investing into these underlying funds. there is also no guarantee that the underlying funds will always have sufficient liquidity to meet the sub -fund s redemption requests as and when made. asset allocation strategy risk the performance of the sub -fund with an asset allocation strategy is partially dependent on the success of the asset allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund at any particular time. accordingly, in such circumstances, there is no assurance that the ass et allocation strategy employed by the sub -fund will be successful and therefore the investment objectives of the sub-fund may not be achieved. also, the investments of the sub -fund may be periodically rebalanced and therefore the sub -fund may incur greate r transaction costs than a fund with static allocation strategy. risks associated with investing in funds with a sustainable investment focus investing in sub -funds with a sustainable investment focus ( si focused funds ) that are primarily exposed to issuers demonstrating sustainability characteristics carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the si focused fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a sustainable investment strategy. the implementation of the sustainable investmen t strategy of a si focused fund may result in foregoing opportunities to buy certain securities when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, and/or selling securities when it might be disadvantageous to do so. this may adversely affect the si focused fund s investment performance. as an si focused fund focuses on esg investments, the value of the sub -fund may be more volatile than that of a fund having a more diverse portfolio of investments. in assessing the eligibility of an issuer, there is a depend ence upon information and data from external research data providers and internal analyses, which may be subjective, incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable. as a result, there is a risk of incorrectly or subjectively assessing a security or issuer or there is a risk that the sub -fund could have exposure to issuers who do not meet the relevant criteria. in addition, there is a lack of standardized taxonomy of esg investments. neither the fund, the management company nor a portfolio manager make any represent ation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, accuracy, reasonableness or completeness of an assessment of external research data, the application of the standards issued by united nations sustainable development goals a nd other sustainability/esg criteria, and the correct execution of sustainability strategy. risks associated with debt securities credit / counterparty risk : the sub -fund is directly and/or indirectly exposed to the credit/ default risk of issuers of the debt securities that the sub -fund may invest in. interest rate risk : investment in the sub -fund is subject to interest rate risk. in general, the prices of debt securities rise when interest rates fall, whilst their prices fall where interest rates rise. volatility and liquidity risk : the debt securities in certain markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to more developed markets. the prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuations. the bid and offer spreads of the price of such securities may be large and the sub -fund may incur significant trading costs. downgrading risk : the credit rating of a debt instrument or its issuer may subsequently be downgraded. in the event of such downgrading, the v alue of the sub -fund may be adversely affected. the portfolio manager may or may not be able to dispose of the debt instruments that are being downgraded. valuation risk : valuation of the sub -fund s investments may involve uncertainties and judgemental determinations. if such variation turns out to be incorrect, this may affect the net asset value calculation of the sub -fund. credit rating risk : credit ratings assigned by rating agencies are subject to limitations and do not guarantee to cred itworthiness of the security and/or the issuer at all times. below investment grade or unrated risk : the sub -fund may be directly and/or indirectly exposed to debt securities rated below investment grade or unrated. such securities are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and - 6 - interest than high -rated debt securities. risks associated with equities the sub -fund's direct and/or indirect exposure to equity securities is subject to general market risks, whose value may fluctuate due to various factors, such as changes in investment sentiment, political and economic conditions and issuer -specific factors. risk of investing in small capitalisation / mi d capitalisation companies : the stocks of small - capitalisation/mid -capitalisation companies may have lower liquidity and their prices are more volatile to adverse economic developments than those of larger capitalisation companies in general. as such, this may adversely impact the sub -fund and/or the interests of investors. currency risk underlying investments of the sub -fund may be denominated in currencies other than the base currency of the sub -fund. also, a class of units may be designated in a currency other than the base currency of the sub -fund. the net asset value of the sub -fund and/or class of unit may be affected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rates between these currencies and the base currency and by changes in exchange rate controls. rmb currency risk rmb is not a freely convertible currency and it is subject to foreign exchange control policies of and repatriation restrictions imposed by the prc government. under exceptional circumstances, payment of redemptions and/or dividend in rmb in respect of rm b denominated classes may be delayed due to the exchange controls and restrictions applicable to rmb . non-rmb based investors are exposed to foreign exchange risk and there is no guarantee that the value of rmb against the investors base currencies (eg. h kd) or the sub -fund s base currency will not depreciate. any depreciation of rmb could adversely affect the value of the investor s investment in the sub -fund. rmb denominated classes are denominated in cnh. the rates of offshore rmb (cnh) and onshore rmb (cny) are different and any divergence between cnh and cny may adversely impact the value of investments in the sub -fund. emerging market risks the sub -fund invests in emerging markets which may involve increased risks and special considerations not typically associated with investment in more developed markets, such as liquidity risks, currency risks/ control, political and economic uncertainties, legal and taxation risks, settlement risks, custody risk and the likelihood of a high degree of volatility. risks associated with investments in instruments with loss -absorption features debt instruments with loss -absorption features are subject to greater risks when compared to traditional debt instruments as such instruments are typically subject to the risk of being written down or converted to ordinary shares upon the occurrence of a pre -defined trigger events (e.g. when the issuer is near or at the point of non -viability or when the issuer s capital ratio falls to a specified l evel), which are likely to be outside of the issuer s control. such trigger events are complex and difficult to predict and may result in a significant or total reduction in the value of such instruments. in the event of the activation of a trigger, there may be potential price contagion and volatility to the entire asset class. debt instruments with loss -absorption features may also be exposed to liquidity, valuation and sector concentration risk. the sub -fund may be exposed to contingent convertible debt securities, commonly known as cocos, which are highly complex and are of high risk. upon the occurrence of the trigger event, cocos may be converted into shares of the issuer (potentially at a discounted price), or may be subject to the permanent write -down to zero. coupon payments on cocos are discretionary and may be cancelled by the issuer at any point, for any reason, and for any length of time. the sub -fund may be exposed to senior non -preferred debts. while these instruments are generally senior to subordinated debts, they may be subject to write -down upon the occurrence of a trigger event and will no longer fall under the creditor ranking hierarchy of the issuer. this may result in total loss of principal invested. - 7 - risks relating to securities lending transactions securities lending transactions may involve the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities lent out in a timely manner and the value of the collateral may fall below the value of the securities lent out. risks of implementing active currency position as the active currency position implemented by the sub -fund may not be correlated with the underlying securities positions held by the sub -fund, the sub -fund may suffer a significant or total loss even if there is no loss of the value of the underlying securities positions being fixed income securities held by the sub -fund. risks associated with distribution out of/effectively out of the sub -fund s capital payment of dividends out of capital amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of an investor s original investment or from any capital gains attributable to that original investment. any such distributions may result in an immediate reduction of the net as set value per unit. the distribution amount and net asset value of the hedged class of units may be adversely affected by differences in the interest rates of the reference currency of the hedged class and the sub -fund s base currency, resulting in an incr ease in the amount of distribution that is paid out of capital and hence a greater erosion of capital than other non -hedged classes. risks relating to unit classes with a fixed percentage in their names constant distributing unit classes must not be seen as alternative to savings account or fixed - interest paying investment. the constant distribution unit class does not distribute a fixed amount. rather a fixed percentage will apply to the nav of the sub -fund as of the end of the month. the constant percentage distribution results in higher absolute distributions when navs are high and in lower absolute distributions when navs are low. hence, the absolute distributions received by investors may vary from mo nth to month. the percentage distribution rate of any unit class is unrelated to expected or past income or return of the unit class or the sub -fund. the distribution can thus be higher or lower than the income and return that were effectively realized. th ese unit classes continue to distribute in periods that the sub -fund has negative return / is making losses, which further reduces the net asset value of the sub -fund. in extreme circumstances, investors may not be able to get back the original investment amount. risk relating to hedged classes the hedging strategy for a class of units which is hedged against the base currency of the sub - fund, may not work as intended, exposing investors of that class to currency risk. additionally, investors of a hedged c lass may be exposed to fluctuations in the net asset value per unit reflecting the gains/losses on and the associated transaction costs of the financial instruments used for hedging, and such investors may be adversely impacted. "," - 8 - past performance information is not indicative of future performance. investors may not get back the full amount invested. the computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, nav -to-nav, with dividend reinvest ed. these figures show by how much the unit class increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. performance data has been calculated in usd including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have t o pay. sub-fund launch date: 1991 p-acc launch date: 1991 p-acc is selected as representative unit class as it is the major unit class subscribed by investors or denominated in the sub -fund s base currency.
