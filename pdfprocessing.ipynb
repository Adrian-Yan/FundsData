This is a mutual fund domiciled in Ireland and its home regulator is the Central Bank of Ireland.   \\n         \\n   \\n \\nObjectives and Investment Strategy     \\n \\nThe investment objective of the Fund aims  to achieve total return, consisting of both income and capital gains,  through investment \\nin a diversified portfolio of fixed income and similar transferable instruments issued primarily by government and corporate entities \\nin Asia.     \\n    \\nThe Fund invests primar ily (at least 70% of its Net Asset Value) in debt securities of governments or quasi -government organization \\nissuers in Asia and /or issuers organised, headquartered or having their primary business operations in Asia. The Fund may also \\ninvest less than 30%  of its Net Asset Value in treasury bonds of the United States Government.  The Fund is actively  managed \\nwithout reference to a benchmark.     70%   \\n    30%    \\n     \\nThe Investment Manager will strategically allocate debt securities based on a combination of top -down and bottom -up analysis.  \\nThe top -down analysis focuses on optimising  the Fund  s exposure to a range of risk factors such as credit spread, duration, country \\nand currency. In order to make decisions on the appropriate exposure to these factors, the Investment Manager undertakes an \\nongoing assessment of the drivers of return s, such as interest rates, the macro -economic outlook, inflation expectations, fiscal and \\nexternal account balances, market sentiment and geo -political issues. The bottom -up analysis focuses on assessing an individual \\ndebt security  s default risk and value  relative to similar debt securities in the market with information such as country/sector and \\ncompany -specific analysis.  Each investment is subject to analysis from the Investment Manager  s credit specialists who assess the \\ncreditworthiness of the issuer  at the time of investment and monitor it continually for changes.     \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\nThe Fund is not subject to any limitation on the portion of its Net Asset Value that may be invested in investment grade debt  \\nsecurities (rated as Baa3 or above by Moody  s Investor Services, Inc. or BB B- or above by Standard & Poor  s Corporation or other \\nrecognised rating agencies) , below investment grade debt and convertible securities, or if unrated, of comparable quality as \\ndetermined by the Investment Manager.  The Fund  s investme nt in debt securities may include securities with loss -absorption \\nfeatures (including contingent convertible debt securities, senior non -preferred debt, instruments issued under the resolution regime \\nfor financial institutions and other capital instruments  issued by banks or other financial institutions) which will be less than 30% of \\nthe Fund  s Net Asset Value.   The Fund may also invest in asset -backed securities and/or mortgage -backed securities but any such \\ninvestment will be less than 30% of its Net Ass et Value.    Baa3  \\n   BBB-    \\n       \\n           \\n  30%    30%  \\nIn addition , the Fund will not invest more than 10% of its Net Asset Value in debt securities issued by and/or guaranteed by a single \\nsovereign issuer which is below investment grade.     10%  \\n   \\nThe Fund is not subject to any limitation on the portion of its Net Asset Value that may be invested in debt securities in an y one or \\nmore emerging markets in Asia, or any sector. In respect of the Fund  s exposure to  PRC, investment in onshore PRC debt \\nsecurities and offshore debt securities denominated in Renminbi ( RMB  ) (including Dim Sum bonds) will be less than 30% of the \\nFund   s Net Asset Value.     \\n         \\n  30%  \\nThe debt securities in which the Fund invests are mainly denominated in US dollars or Asian  currencies.   First Sentier Asia Strategic  Bond Fund  \\n     \\n Issued by First Sentier Investors (Hong Kong) Limited     5        \\nAlthough the F und has a regional investment universe, the securities selected for investment based on the Investment Manager  s \\napproach may at times result in a portfolio that is concentrated in certain countries.   \\n   \\nThe Fund may invest less than 30 % of its Net Asset Value in onshore debt securities in the PRC via Bond Connect.   \\n  30%   \\nThe Fund may only use fin ancial derivative instruments (  FDIs  ) for purposes of hedging and efficient portfolio management. It is \\nnot intended that the Fund will avail of the opportunity to invest in FDIs for investment purposes.   \\n         \\nFor defensive purposes during periods of perceived uncertainty an d volatility (e.g. market or major crisis), the Fund may also hold \\nall or part of its assets in cash and/or US Treasuries.      \\n   \\nBenchmark information:     \\nThe Fund is actively managed meaning that the Investment Manager uses its expertise to pick investments rather than tracking the \\nallocation and therefore the performance of a benchmark.   \\n     \\nThe Fund  s performance is not managed in reference to a benchmark.      \\n \\nUse of Derivatives     \\nThe Fund  s net derivative exposure may be up to 50% of the Fund  s Net Asset Value.   \\n  50%  \\n \\nWhat are the key risks?     ? \\nInvestment involves risks. Please refer to the offering document for details including the risk factors.  \\n   \\n  Investment Risk   The value of the Fund  s investment portfolio may fall due to any of the key risk factors below and therefore \\nyour investment in the Fund may suffer losses. There is no guarantee of the repayment of principal.  \\n   \\n   \\n  Single Country/Specific Region Risk   The Fund  s investments may be concentrated in a single country or a small number of \\ncountries in Asia. The value of the Fund may be more volatile than a fund having a more diversified portfolio of investments \\ncovering multiple countries. The value of the Fund may be more susceptible to an adverse economic, political, policy, foreign  \\nexchange, liqui dity, tax, legal or regulatory event affecting the relevant market.  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  Concentrated Risk   Although the Fund has a global or regional investme nt universe, it may at times invest a large portion of \\nits assets in certain geographical area(s) or countries.  \\n     \\n  Emerging Markets Risk   Investing in emerging markets (countries considered to have social or business activity in the \\nprocess of rapid growth and development) may involve increased risks and special considerations not typically associated with  \\ninvestment in developed markets. T hese risks may include liquidity risk, currency risks/control, political and economic \\nuncertainties, legal and taxation risks, settlement risks, custody risks, the likelihood of a high degree of volatility, mark et \\nsuspension, restrictions on foreign invest ment and control on repatriation of capital.  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  High Yield Risk   Investing in fixed income securities that are rated below investment grade or are unrated, while usually \\noffering higher yields, are generally subject to lower liquidity, higher volatility and greater risk of loss of principal and  interest First Sentier Asia Strategic  Bond Fund  \\n     \\n6 Issued by First Sentier Investors (Hong Kong) Limited      than high -rated debt securities.  \\n     \\n   \\n  Sovereign Debt Risk   Investing in debt securities issued or guaranteed by governmental entities will subject the Fund to the \\npolitical, social and economic risks of such entities. In adv erse situations, the Fund may be requested to participate in the \\nrestructuring of such debt or to extend further loans to government debtors or sovereign issuers may not be able or willing t o \\nrepay the principal and/or interest when due. The Fund may have limited legal recourse if the debtor defaults and the Fund may \\nsuffer loss as a result.  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  Convertible Bond Risk   Convertible bonds are a hybrid between debt and equity, permitting the holders to convert into shares \\nin the company issuing the bond at a specified future date. The Fund may invest in convertible debt securities which will be \\nexposed to equity movement a nd may show greater volatility than straight bond investments with an increased risk of capital \\nloss. Factors that may affect the value of convertible bonds include credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prep ayment \\nrisk associated with compara ble straight bond investments. Convertible bonds may also have call provisions and other features \\nwhich may give rise to the risk of a call. The value and performance of the Fund may be affected as a result.  \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n  Below Investment Grade Debt Securities and Unrated Debt Securities Risk   Investing in below investment grade \\nsecurities and unrated debt securities is more volatile and involves a greater risk of default and price changes due to chang es in \\nthe issuer  s creditworthiness. These securities are generally subject to higher volatility and greater  risk of loss of principal and \\ninterest than high -rated debt securities. Settlement of transactions may be subject to delay and administrative uncertainties. The \\nmarket for these securities may be illiquid and the Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose  of such securities quickly.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n  Downgrading Risk   Investment grade securities may  be subject to the risk of being downgraded. In the event of downgrading \\nin the credit ratings of a debt instrument or an issuer relating to a debt, the Fund  s investment value in such security may be \\nadversely affected. The Investment Manager may or may n ot be able to dispose of the debt instruments that are being \\ndowngraded.  \\n   \\n   \\n  Credit Risk   Investing in debt or other fixed income securities may expose the Fund to  credit risk if the issuers of those \\nsecurities fail to meet their financial obligations, default or suffer insolvency. This would cause the value of the Fund to be \\naffected negatively.  \\n   \\n     \\n  Interest Rate Risk   Investing in fixed income securities will expose the Fund to movements in interest rates. If rates go up, the \\nvalue of securities fall and if rates go down, the value of securities rise.  \\n     \\n   \\n  Volatility and Liquidity Risk   The securities in certain markets may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity compared \\nto more developed markets. The prices of securities traded in such markets may be subject to fluctuati ons. \\n   \\n   \\n  Valuation Risk   Valuation of the Fund  s investments may involve uncertainties and judgmental determinations. If such \\nvaluation turns out to be incorrect, this may affect the Net Asset Value of the Fund.  \\n     \\n  Reliability of Credit Ratings   Credit ratings assigned by rating agencies are subject to limitations and do not guarantee the \\ncreditworthiness of the security and/or issuer at all times.  \\n     First Sentier Asia Strategic  Bond Fund  \\n     \\n Issued by First Sentier Investors (Hong Kong) Limited     7     Market Risk   The Fund  s investment in securities is subject to general market risks, and their values may fluctuate due to \\nvarious factors, such as changes in investor sentiment, political and economic conditions and issuer -specific factors.  \\n   \\n   \\n  Currency Risk   The Fund may buy fixed income securities in currencies other than the base currency of the Fund and a share \\nclass may be designated in  a currency other than the base currency of the Fund. The Net Asset Value of the Fund may be \\naffected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies and the base currency and by changes in \\nexchange rate controls.  \\n       \\n   \\n  Restricted Currency Risk   The Fund may invest in debt securities denominated in Asian currencies. Certain Asian currencies \\nmay not be freely convertible subject to exchange controls and restrictions. Investors may be exposed to foreign exchange ris k \\nand the Net Asset Value of the  Fund may be affected unfavourably by fluctuations in the exchange rates between these \\ncurrencies and the base currency of the Fund.  \\n   -    \\n          \\n  Derivatives Risk   The Fund may use FDIs for purposes of hedging and efficient portfolio management. FDIs that are not \\ntraded on an exchange are subject to, among others, liquidity risk (i.e. the risk that the Fund may not be able to close out a \\nderivative  position in a timely manner and/or at a reasonable price), counterparty risks (i.e. the risk that a counterparty may \\nbecome insolvent and therefore unable to meet its obligations under a transaction), valuation risk, volatility risk and over -the-\\ncounter t ransaction risk. The leverage component of an FDI can result in loss significantly greater than the amount invested in \\nthe FDI by the Fund. In adverse situations, the use of FDIs may become ineffective in achieving hedging or efficient portfoli o \\nmanagement  and may lead to a high risk of significant losses by the Fund.  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  Currency Hedged Share Class Risk   The Fund may issue classes where the class currency is different to the base currency \\nof the Fund. Accordingly the value of an investor  s investment may be affected favourably or unfavourably by fluctuations in the \\nrates of the different currencies. The Fu nd may create currency hedged share classes to hedge the resulting currency exposure \\nback into the currency of the relevant class. In addition the Fund may invest in assets with various currency denominations \\nother than the base currency, and the Fund may hedge currency exposure due to investing in assets denominated in currencies \\nother than the Fund  s base currency.  \\nWhilst these hedging strategies aim to reduce the losses to an investor  s investment if the currency of that currency hedged \\nshare class or th e currencies of the underlying assets which are denominated in currencies other than the Fund  s base currency \\nfall against that of the base currency of the Fund the use of hedging strategies may substantially limit investor in the rele vant \\nclass from benef iting if the currency of that currency hedged share class rises against that of the base currency of the Fund \\nand/ or the currency in which the assets of the Fund are denominated.  \\nInvestors should be aware that there may be circumstances in which a hedging  transaction may reduce currency gains that \\nwould otherwise arise in the valuation of the Fund. The gains/losses on, and the costs of, such hedging transactions will, to  the \\nextent permitted by applicable law and regulation, be borne on a pro rata basis by  the currency hedged share classes.  \\nInvestors in currency hedged share classes should be aware that the currency hedging process for both types of currency \\nhedged share classes may not give a precise hedge. Hedging transactions are designed to reduce, as m uch as possible, the \\ncurrency risk for investors. However, there is no guarantee that the hedging will be totally successful and no hedging strate gy \\ncan eliminate currency risk entirely. Should a hedging strategy be incomplete or unsuccessful, the value of  the Fund  s assets \\nand income can remain vulnerable to fluctuations in currency exchange rate movements.  \\nInvestors in the currency hedged share classes may have exposure to currencies other than the currency of their share class \\nand may also be exposed to the risks associated with the instruments used in the hedging process.  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n   First Sentier Asia Strategic  Bond Fund  \\n     \\n8 Issued by First Sentier Investors (Hong Kong) Limited         \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n  RMB Currency and Conversion Risks     RMB  is currently not freely convertible and is subject to exchange controls and \\nrestrictions.
