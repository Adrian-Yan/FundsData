       "' objective the investment objective of the sub-fund is to provide income and capital appreciation through primarily investing in a portfolio of debt securities. there can be no assurance that the sub-fund will achieve its investment objective. strategy the sub-fund seeks to achieve its objective primarily through investing in debt securities. the sub-fund makes investments into debt securities that, in the manager s opinion, have been undervalued or mis-priced by the market. there is no restriction on the geographies, industries or credit ratings in relation to the debt securities in which the sub-fund may invest. the sub-fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. the manager will adopt a dynamic approach in asset allocation and security selection, based on a number of factors including macroeconomic analysis, issuer s credit analysis, and security valuation. the sub-fund may from time to time invest up to 100% of its net asset value in emerging markets, such as mainland china, india, indonesia, malaysia and the philippines, subject to an overall upper limit of 50% of the sub-fund s net asset value on onshore china exposure. principal investments the sub-fund s asset allocation strategy is that it will primarily invest (i.e. at least 70% of its net asset value) directly and indirectly (such as through exchange traded funds and other collective investment schemes) in debt securities denominated in usd or other currencies and issued by governments, public institutions, international organisations, financial institutions and other corporations, including mainland china property developers. types of debt securities in which the sub-fund may invest will include (but are not limited to) convertible or non-convertible debt securities and fixed and floating rate bonds. the sub-fund may invest up to 30% of its net asset value in convertible debt securities. the sub-fund may from time to time invest up to 100% of its net asset value in debt securities in emerging markets, subject to the overall upper limit of 50% of the sub-fund s net asset value on onshore china exposure as described above. the sub-fund does not impose any minimum credit rating requirement on debt securities and may invest up to 100% of its net asset value in debt securities which are rated below investment grade (i.e. below bbb- /baa3 by an internationally recognised credit rating agency, such as standard & poor s, moody s and/or fitch) or unrated (meaning neither the security itself nor its issuer has a credit rating). however, the sub-fund may invest no more than 10% of its net asset value in debt securities issued and/or guaranteed by a single sovereign issuer (including its government, public or local authority) which is below investment grade. the sub-fund may invest up to 30% of its net asset value in debt instruments with loss-absorption features (e.g. contingent convertible securities, senior non-preferred debt,
